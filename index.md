## Overview

### The Problem
The Hawaii Department of Education has an outdated legislative tracking system (LTS) that has slow and inconvenient workflows, as well as a deprecated server. Their current system manager retires within the next five years and there would be no other member to provide support for the LTS.  They want to upgrade, modernize, and replace their current LTS before their current system manager retires.

### The Solution
Our solution is to make a tracker that encompasses the required “Key Components” outlined in the sections of the home page. For example, we will add these features to: Add, Remove, and Store bills, the ability to sort the viewed bills by preference of user, and have notifications sent out via email that the user has signed up with. A potential feature to be suggested is a new in-client mailbox/notification system. The New LTS will increase the clarity and legibility of the previous system by eliminating unnecessary clutter and allow for easier navigation of the web page to the user. Overall our solution and or goal is to **enable HIDOE to track legislation and set up workflow processes more efficiently and accurately than before.**

- First, [install meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install).
- Second, download the [hidoe-legistracker repository](https://github.com/hidoe-legistracker/hidoe-legistracker) into your local system.
- Third, open a terminal and navigate into the hidoe-legistracker/app directory.
- Fourth, install the required meteor libraries by typing the following into the terminal:
